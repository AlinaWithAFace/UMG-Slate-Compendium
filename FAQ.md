1. QUESTION: I found an issue I wanted to report, what's the next steps? \
ANSWER: Please go to the "Issues" tab of this GitHub repository and make a new issue for that, 
I have a template for certain types of issues but the general format is to include: 
   - What the issue is.
   - Where its located(including the section number is extremely helpful so the author knows that you're referring to).
   - -OPTIONAL- Suggesting a fixed version(if applicable) to help get the fix in quicker(the templates will explicitly say whether you should have a suggestion or not).

2. QUESTION: I want to help contribute to this document! How can I do that? \
ANSWER: You can make a fork of the repository and then make a pull request to merge your contribution(s) into this repository like if you were contributing to Unreal Engine. You are required that you have written permission from your place of business to contribute(it can be in any forms but it needs to be in written form as proof sort of thing), this avoid any legal issues regarding "trade secrets" being revealed but even then if the information is referring to the Launcher/public Github repository of Unreal Engine then it shouldn't be an issue for them to approve it.

3. QUESTION: What's the policy regarding Pull Requests? \
ANSWER: 
    - You must be polite and respectful to others(you get 3 chances but depending on severity it may be less, use your best judgement obviously). We're all using Unreal Engine, somebody may be more experienced with it but that does not give you the right to be a jerk and vise versa.
    - If you work at a business that uses Unreal Engine(or something related to it), you must have written(NOT VERBAL) permission from that business that you can contribute to the project even if its a one-off contribution. This is to avoid legal issues regarding revealing "trade secrets", but even if the information is referring to the Launcher/public Github repository of Unreal Engine then it shouldn't be an issue for them to approve it.

4. QUESTION: What is the process of Pull Requests? \
ANSWER: 
    1. Fork the repository.
    2. Create a branch on your forked repository for your changes to be encapsulated and contained to that branch.
    3. Make your changes in your branch of your forked repository.
    4. When your ready to bring it into this respository, create a pull request from your branch to be merged into the branch named: `main` of this repository.
    5. Fill out the pull request with a detailed description of your changes, **DO NOT add any reviewers!** the maintainers of this repository will do this. **DO NOT @ anybody that hasn't commented on the pull request already**.
    6. A maintainer will comment with any issues they see in the changes and you can make those edits(this is general pull request back and forth). A maintainer will also comment if the pull request is approved/rejected and then add a tag for `Rejected`/`Approved`/`In Progress`.
    7. The maintainer will handle merging the pull request into the project and then closing the pull request. At this point you can delete your branch.

5. QUESTION: This document is awesome! I want to donate money or something to show my support that it keeps getting updated! \
ANSWER: This document is meant to be 100% free with no strings attached, I WILL NOT accept any sort of donation's(unless its knowledge donations to make the document better). I will keep updating it until I am physically no longer able to(we'll cross that bridge when we get to it). Anybody that contributes to this compendium should not be asking for donations to contribute, anybody found violating that rule will be immediately banned from contributing.

6. QUESTION: I have a suggestion for something to add to the document! What's the next steps? \
ANSWER: Please go to the "Issues" tab of this GitHub repository and make a new issue for that.
---
7. QUESTION: How do I see what's planned for the document? \
ANSWER: So there's two parts to that;
  - I will have an issue labeled `Planned xx.xx.xx Updates` and in there I will say is being worked on for the next update. You can see live progress on it where I will check off the privately filled out information(again the reason why is explained at the top of the FAQ), OR if somebody has made a Pull Request for it and it was merged into the public repository then its immediately available. The issue will be closed and marked as done when all of the update's have been merged into the public repository.
  - For long term planned updates they are pretty much planned in my head but not being actively worked on or posted publicly, so that if somebody is working on one of that same chunk of knowledge as a public contribution then they don't have to assume its being worked on behind the scenes and can hopefully get it into the compendium earlier than if I did it myself(updates/additions will be over time obviously).

8. QUESTION: I'm working on a contribution that I want to merge in but I saw a new update ticket(issue) was made that conflicts with my contribution, what do I do? \
ANSWER: First off, GREAT! Thank you for contributing I really appreciate it! Secondly, make a draft pull request for the compendium so I can track it's progress(and possibly contribute to it if you want), then make a comment on the update ticket letting me know that you're working on that contribution and include the draft pull request link.
