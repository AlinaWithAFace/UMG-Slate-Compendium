# UMG-Slate Compendium FAQ(Frequently Asked Questions)

*As a heads up I have to have every major update to the compendium approved by my job(which means it may take a while between some updates because of this). \
This is to avoid "company secrets" being revealed, but everything I reference in the compendium is publicly available since 
I only reference the launcher and public github source code so it shouldn't have any issues with being approved.*
